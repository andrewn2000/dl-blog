<h1 id="why-did-i-ever-start-the-ethics-course">Why did I ever start the Ethics course?!?!</h1>

<p>As I stated previously, I never really thought (or cared) about ethics.  I was only interested in taking my technological skills to the next level.
This ethics thing got me interested.
I’m not really a fan of academia, but in the course there are many articles written in just that.
I watched Lesson 2 of the ethics course and there was a lot of overlap in the book, chapter 3.
But the links and other reading materials lead one to rethink their roles in technology.</p>

<p>But I digress…</p>

<p>My study group got bumped from its original date and I start on Tuesday, Sept 8 a day after the Labor Day Holiday.<br />
I hope I have more than just 2 or 3, making it fun and interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this has me studying and preparing for those lessons as I don’t want me to the drag in the study group that I’m HOSTING!</p>

<p>I watched a little bit of the AICamp and was disappointed in Automated ML.
Maybe I’m just getting too advanced in DL these days.</p>

<p>Now I’m reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010">Datasheets for Datasets</a> and thought it was an interesting concept, but not sure how that’s going to go well with everyone doing there own thing these days.</p>

<p>Until tomorrow.</p>
