<h1 id="hiking-failure">Hiking Failure</h1>
<p>I had it all planned.  I had been building up my endurance and wanted to give my new diet the challenge of hiking San Bernadino Peak for a total of 16.9 miles!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Permit - check</li>
  <li>Water - check</li>
  <li>Emergency gear - check</li>
  <li>Backpack - check</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the heat..and now its predicted to be 115 degrees in that area.<br />
Phoobar, but maybe God didn’t want me hiking and burn up just a few days before my debut on TWiML, continue reading below!</p>

<p>I decided to keep going through the video lessons and get to the part where I’m supposed to blog my experience.
I get through most of the notebook without issues and even sign up with paperspace with the discount code added.
<strong>NOTE</strong> If you don’t sign up, they wont give you even the FREE machines to use like the FREE-P5000. (Once I signed up, they magically became available…)</p>

<p>I didn’t sign up for Google Colab because I figured I’d be slow at needed the GPUs anyway.
I also read on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/colab-pro-is-it-worth-the-money-32a1744f42a8">Daniel Radecic’s Colab Pro:  Is it Worth the Money? on Medium</a>
Most of my time will be watching the lectures and reading the book, while running the code now-and-then.
I’m not at the point where I’m banging on the GPU just yet with all my DL, but I hope to change that soon.</p>

<p>Then Jose contacted me and said I had 16 people in my slack thread.  Wait?!?! What?
That thing only went out today, so I better post up some content and make everyone welcomed and excited to join the study group!
In case someone wants to check it out:<a href="https://twimlai.com/program/fast-ai-practical-deep-learning-for-coders-study-group/">TWIML Fast AI Practical Deel Learning for Coders</a></p>

<p>My take away is that instead of passively learning it, I might as well jump in with both feet, make some new friends around the world.
Now I should really learn how to publish my own notebooks as blog posts with fastbook eh?</p>
