<h1 id="books-and-notes-and-more-notes">Books and notes, and more notes!</h1>

<p>Here we go AGAIN!
Skipping to FastAI v2, is somewhat different.  First, I’ve been through several of the v1 videos and got the terminology in my head.  So it was a refresher and breather
that I’m able to get through video 1 of the new course without too many ????</p>

<p>That said, just resetting my brain and getting in the flow of study might be a bit challenging.
I remembered how the blog was <em>supposed</em> to work, and now putting in my daily notes.
I forgot how the jupyter notes worked and fired up my anaconda.</p>

<p>I was studying Python for a bit and saw a lot of my old notebooks, but wanted to know how to push them up to github using fastai’s template.</p>

<p>But maybe that’s all the old way as I see now they have Colab, Gradient and DataCrunch.
All look very cool, but I’m used to Google Colab and will start from there.</p>

<p>I complained to Oreily on this, but the actual book is located here:</p>

<p>https://github.com/fastai/fastbook
and the clean version is supposedly the stripped down version</p>

<p>However, note the instructions like on Colab about getting the actual jupyter notebooks and you’ll notice that you could just use those.
See you tomorrow!</p>
