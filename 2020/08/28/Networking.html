<p>Before I dive into my journey, I thought I’d get a lay of the land first and reach out and make new contacts and friends.
My first thought is just plowing through the material like before, but I run into some difficulties with this.</p>

<p>Challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No accountability for anything, schedule, learning path/objectives, finding creative projects that resonate with me, etc</li>
  <li>Not sure if I’m headed in the right direction or veering off course into a tangent that wont serve me</li>
  <li>Limiting my opportunities of not getting a bigger picture</li>
</ol>

<p>After digging through the forums, I found an interesting site at <a href="https://twimlai.com">TWIML Community</a></p>

<p>So I figued just getting involved here might be a better fit than the FastAI Forums.</p>

<p>Also, it might be good to have a checklist on things I need/want to accomplish (such as creating a Paperspace account, figuring out to publish jupyter notebooks to github, etc.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I also would like to be more diligent wriiting here and documenting my journey for those coming after me.
Let’s see how far I get today.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
I was able to meet with Jose Ochoa (and oshan) from TWIML.  We discussed next steps but it may be that I start my course right as I was thinking on Sept 9.
Very excited.  Also made paperspace account and it had a github settings so not sure if they will go in there or not.
In paperspace, I had to wait until a free server was available as I was going to put a cc but thought I’d better wait.  Good thing I did just to try it out.</p>
